To run server: 
1. ensure node.js is installed
2. navigate to /backend folder (or include in file path)
3. create .env file with contents from @Hritik in text chain
3. run: node ./index.js

NOTE: On Mac, port 5000 is used by default by AirPlay Receiver. You must turn that off if server is still set to 5000 (should be changed eventually)
